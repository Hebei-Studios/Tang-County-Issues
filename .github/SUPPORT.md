### I have a question...
Open an issue! We always welcome and value newcomers. We hope to build a better community of developers and encourage better practices.
By opening an issue you might save someone's time. They won't have to wait for an answer, it was already answered by someone else.
You also help our game grow and become better for our players.

### Something isn't working.
Found a bug? Don't know how to fix it? Again, open an issue and let us know. Your problems are our problems as a community of developers.

***Please be patient while waiting for an answer.***
